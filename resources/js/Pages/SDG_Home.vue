                <strong>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>, also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
                The 17 SDGs are integratedâ€”they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability.
                This is a committed effort to prioritize progress so that <em>no one is left behind</em>.
